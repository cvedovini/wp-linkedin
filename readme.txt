== Description ==

This plugin provides you with shortcodes to insert your full LinkedIn profile and a rotating scroller of your LinkedIn recommendations in any Wordpress page or post.


== Installation ==

This plugin follows the [standard WordPress installation method](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins):

1. Upload the `wp-linkedin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to the LinkedIn Developer Network and sign-up for a LinkedIn Application Key <https://www.linkedin.com/secure/developer>
1. Go to the settings page for the plugin and fill in the key, secrets and token fields.
1. The `Profile fields` field is the list of fields that will be available to the template for rendering (see below for template customization).

There are two shortcodes available:

* [li_recommendations width="480" length="200" interval="1000"] displays a rotating scroller with the recommendations you received
* [li_profile] displays your LinkedIn profile. Optional attributes are `fields` and `lang` to overide the general settings but you can pass any attribute and use it in customized templates.


To customize the rendering of both shortcodes you must create a `linkedin` folder in your theme and then copy the template file you want to modify.
The default template files, `recommendations.php` and `profile.php`, are located in the plugin's `templates` folder.
